# Villages Management System

This project is a refactored and enhanced version of [the original Villages Management System](https://github.com/shehab-kharaz/villages-management-system), which was an only-frontend application built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. **In this version, the app is restructured using React, introducing a scalable, and component-based architecture.**
